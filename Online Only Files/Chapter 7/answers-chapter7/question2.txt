It depends on the type of triangle. If the triangle to be textured is a right triangle with the right angle on the top left, the coordinates in counterclockwise order would be:
(0,0)
(0,1)
(1,1)

If the right angle is on the bottom right, it would be
(1,0)
(0,1)
(1,1)

and so on if the right angle was bottom left or top right.

For a regular triangle (one where all angles are 60 degrees), the coordinates would be
(1,0)
(1,1)
(0.5,0)
